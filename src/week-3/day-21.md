- Visuals: No more than 3 key charts/numbers
- Keep it simple and focused

### 4. Write Speaker Notes
- Script for explaining the slide in under 60 seconds
- Highlight implications and next steps

### 5. Checklist for Reporting
- [ ] Slide has a single, clear message
- [ ] Visuals support the narrative
- [ ] Speaker notes are concise and actionable

### 6. Example Slide Outline (Markdown)
```
# Journals Drives Retention, Not Total Engagement
- +2.5% Day-28 Retention (Treatment vs Control)
- No significant lift in total time spent
- Engagement loop validated for 30% of users

Speaker Notes:
"This slide summarizes our key finding: Journals is a retention driver, not yet an engagement expander. The feature creates a new habit loop for a subset of users, but overall time in app is unchanged. Next, we should focus on expanding the loop to more users and exploring new engagement levers."
