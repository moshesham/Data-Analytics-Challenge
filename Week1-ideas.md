You are absolutely right. My previous response, while strong on product strategy and framing, leaned too heavily on the "PM" perspective and was too light on the rigorous, hands-on **technical and mathematical skill development** that is the core purpose of this masterclass. An analyst who can't execute is just a strategist.

This is an excellent and necessary course correction. Let's rebuild Week 1 with a dual-focus: every task must serve a clear product purpose **AND** be a vehicle for mastering a specific, crucial technical or statistical skill.

### **Revised Philosophy: The "T-Shaped" Analyst**

We will develop a "T-shaped" analyst. The "top" of the T is the broad product and business acumen. The "stem" of the T is the deep, undeniable technical and quantitative expertise. This new curriculum will build both simultaneously. Each day will now explicitly call out the technical and mathematical skills being mastered.

## **The 30-Day Product Analytics Masterclass: Week 1 (Technically Rigorous Revision)**

### **Week 1: Pre-Launch – The Opportunity and The Plan**
*(**My Goal as PM:** To guide my analyst to produce the data-backed artifacts needed for a go/no-go decision, while ensuring they are building the foundational technical skills required for the rest of the sprint.)*

---

### **# Day 01: The Data Warehouse & The Spark of an Idea**

#### **The PM's Briefing:**
"Welcome. Before we can build anything, we need to find a signal in the noise. I have a hunch users want more private spaces, but I need you to prove it. Connect to our data warehouse and see if you can find evidence of this in our user feedback data."

#### **Your Objective (As the Analyst):**
To validate a user need by performing keyword extraction and sentiment analysis on raw text data.

#### **Technical Skill Focus:**
*   **SQL:** Mastering `LIKE`, `ILIKE`, and basic regular expressions (`~*` in PostgreSQL syntax) for text pattern matching.
*   **Data Exploration:** Using `GROUP BY`, `COUNT`, `AVG` to summarize unstructured data.
*   **Environment:** Setting up and connecting to a DuckDB instance, simulating a real data warehouse connection.

#### **Key Tasks & Deliverables:**
1.  **Connect to 'Warehouse':** Use the `load_data_duckdb.py` script to load the raw `.parquet` and `.csv` files into a DuckDB instance.
2.  **Keyword Extraction:** In your `keyword_search.sql` file, write a query that uses a regular expression to find all reviews in `app_store_reviews` that mention words like 'diary', 'journal', 'private', 'thoughts', or 'notes'.
3.  **Basic Sentiment Analysis:** Write a second SQL query that calculates the `COUNT` of reviews and the `AVG(star_rating)` for both the "Journal-related" reviews and all other reviews.
4.  **Deliverable:** A markdown cell in your `Day_01_Challenge.ipynb` notebook that includes:
    *   The SQL query you wrote.
    *   A table summarizing the results (Total Reviews, Avg Rating vs. Journal-Related Reviews, Avg Rating).
    *   A one-sentence conclusion about the validity of the signal.

---

### **# Day 02: Opportunity Sizing & Statistical Significance**

#### **The PM's Briefing:**
"You found a signal, and it looks positive. Now, let's get specific. Who are these users? Are they our best users, or a niche group? More importantly, is their higher-than-average rating a real, statistically significant difference, or just random chance? I need to know if this segment is worth chasing."

#### **Your Objective (As the Analyst):**
To quantify the user segment identified on Day 1 and determine if their positive sentiment is statistically significant, introducing the fundamentals of hypothesis testing.

#### **Technical Skill Focus:**
*   **SQL:** Advanced `JOIN`s (joining the review segment back to `users` and `events` tables), CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for readability.
*   **Python (Pandas):** Performing data manipulation and analysis on query results.
*   **Math/Stats Focus:**
    *   **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculating mean, median, and standard deviation for key metrics.
    *   **Hypothesis Testing:** Introduction to the concept. Formulating a Null Hypothesis (`H₀`) and an Alternative Hypothesis (`H₁`).
    *   **T-Test:** Performing a two-sample t-test to compare the mean star ratings of the two groups (Journal-related vs. non-Journal-related).

#### **Key Tasks & Deliverables:**
1.  **Isolate & Join:** Write a SQL query using a CTE to get the `user_id`s from Day 1 and `JOIN` them to the `users` table to get their properties (e.g., `signup_date`, `country`).
2.  **Descriptive Stats:** In `Day_02_Challenge.ipynb`, load the results and calculate descriptive statistics for the "Journal" user segment vs. the general population. Are they older accounts? More active?
3.  **Hypothesis Formulation:** Formally state your hypotheses:
    *   `H₀`: There is no difference in the mean star rating between users who mention journaling and those who do not.
    *   `H₁`: The mean star rating of users who mention journaling is higher than those who do not.
4.  **Perform T-Test:** Use `scipy.stats.ttest_ind` to perform the t-test on the star ratings of the two groups.
5.  **Deliverable:** A completed `Day_02_Challenge.ipynb` notebook that includes:
    *   Your analysis of the user segment's characteristics.
    *   Your formally stated hypotheses.
    *   The code for the t-test and its output (t-statistic and p-value).
    *   A clear conclusion in plain English: "The higher average star rating of the 'Journal' segment is statistically significant (p < 0.05), providing strong evidence that this is a genuinely happier and distinct user group."

### **# Day 03: A/B Test Design & Probability Fundamentals**

#### **The PM's Briefing:**
"The board approved the project based on your analysis. Now we need a bulletproof measurement plan. The core of this is our A/B test. I need you to define the metrics and, critically, determine the sample size we need. We can't afford to run an underpowered test that gives us a 'maybe' answer."

#### **Your Objective (As the Analyst):**
To design a statistically sound A/B test, introducing the core concepts of statistical power, effect size, and their relationship to sample size calculation.

#### **Technical Skill Focus:**
*   **Analytical Design:** Translating a business goal into a measurable experimental design.
*   **Python:** Writing a function to calculate sample size.
*   **Math/Stats Focus:**
    *   **Probability (Binomial Distribution):** Understanding that conversion rates (like retention) are binomial events (a user is either retained or not).
    *   **Statistical Power:** Grasping the concept of Power (1 - β), the probability of detecting an effect if it exists.
    *   **Significance Level (α):** The probability of a Type I error.
    *   **Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE):** The smallest lift you want your test to be able to reliably detect.

#### **Key Tasks & Deliverables:**
1.  **Define Metrics:** In `reports/ab_test_analysis.md`, formally define the Primary Metric (User Day-28 Retention) and Guardrail Metrics.
2.  **Understand the Inputs:** Research and define the key inputs for a power calculation:
    *   Baseline conversion rate (our D28 retention is 25%).
    *   Minimum Detectable Effect (we want to detect a 2% relative lift, so an absolute lift from 25% to 25.5%).
    *   Alpha (α), conventionally 0.05.
    *   Power (1 - β), conventionally 0.80.
3.  **Calculate Sample Size:** In `Day_03_Challenge.ipynb`, either use a library like `statsmodels.stats.power` or write your own Python function that implements a standard sample size formula for proportions.
4.  **Deliverable:** The completed `Day_03_Challenge.ipynb` notebook containing the sample size calculation and a markdown cell explaining *in your own words* what "Statistical Power" means and why an underpowered test is wasteful. The final `ab_test_analysis.md` should be updated with the required sample size.

### **# Day 04: The Quasi-Experiment Backup Plan & Regression Basics**

#### **The PM's Briefing:**
"Curveball. Marketing is forcing a Canada-only launch. Our clean A/B test is out for the MVP. I need a Plan B. I've heard of 'Difference-in-Differences.' Can you set up the analysis and prove to me that it's a credible way to measure impact?"

#### **Your Objective (As the Analyst):**
To set up a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis, understanding its underlying linear model and the critical "parallel trends" assumption.

#### **Technical Skill Focus:**
*   **Data Wrangling (Pandas):** Reshaping data into the format required for a DiD analysis (pre/post periods, treatment/control groups).
*   **Visualization (Matplotlib/Seaborn):** Plotting time series data to visually inspect for parallel trends.
*   **Math/Stats Focus:**
    *   **Linear Regression:** Understanding that DiD is fundamentally a linear regression model: `y = β₀ + β₁(time) + β₂(group) + β₃(time*group)`. The `β₃` coefficient is the DiD estimator.
    *   **Interaction Terms:** Grasping the concept of an interaction term (`time*group`) and what it represents.

#### **Key Tasks & Deliverables:**
1.  **Select Groups & Check Parallel Trends:** In `Day_04_Challenge.ipynb`, select your Treatment (Canada) and Control (e.g., Australia) groups. Plot their average daily retention for the 90 days *before* the planned launch on the same line chart. They should move in parallel.
2.  **Set up the Regression:** Create a Pandas DataFrame with columns for `retention`, `is_post_launch` (0 or 1), `is_treatment_group` (0 or 1), and the crucial interaction term `is_post_launch * is_treatment_group`.
3.  **Run the Model:** Use `statsmodels.formula.api` to run the OLS regression model based on the formula above.
4.  **Deliverable:** A completed `Day_04_Challenge.ipynb` notebook that includes:
    *   The parallel trends plot with a conclusion on its validity.
    *   The code setting up and running the regression model.
    *   An interpretation of the model's summary output, specifically explaining what the coefficient and p-value for the interaction term mean. This is your DiD effect.

### **# Day 05: The BI Dashboard Simulation & Data Modeling**

#### **The PM's Briefing:**
"The engineers are asking for the data spec for the launch dashboard. They need to know what events to log and what the final tables should look like. I need you to design the data model and write the 'source of truth' queries for them."

#### **Your Objective (As the Analyst):**
To design a simple data model and write production-ready SQL, practicing the skill of creating clear, unambiguous specifications for engineering partners.

#### **Technical Skill Focus:**
*   **Data Modeling:** Thinking about how data should be structured for efficient querying (e.g., creating an aggregated daily summary table).
*   **Advanced SQL:** Using `WINDOW` functions (e.g., `LAG()` to calculate day-over-day changes), `DATE_TRUNC` for time-series aggregation, and CTEs to build complex, multi-step queries.

#### **Key Tasks & Deliverables:**
1.  **Design Data Model:** In `reports/dashboards/journals_launch_monitoring_dashboard.md`, define a schema for a new table called `daily_journals_summary`. It should include columns like `date`, `total_adopters`, `new_adopters`, `new_adopters_change_vs_prior_day`, `avg_time_spent_in_feature`.
2.  **Write Production SQL:** Write the complex SQL query that would run daily to populate this table. This query must read from the raw `events` table and use `GROUP BY`, `DATE_TRUNC`, and `WINDOW` functions to calculate all the necessary fields.
3.  **Deliverable:** The completed spec document containing the table schema and the heavily-commented, production-ready SQL query.

### **# Day 06: Proactive Discovery & The Power Law Distribution**

#### **The PM's Briefing:**
"Time for some blue-sky thinking. I want you to go on a data expedition. Don't wait for me to ask a question. Find an interesting pattern in our user engagement data and present it back to me with a hypothesis about what it means for our product."

#### **Your Objective (As the Analyst):**
To practice proactive data exploration and to identify and understand the Power Law distribution, a fundamental concept in social and product data.

#### **Technical Skill Focus:**
*   **Data Exploration (Pandas/SQL):** Querying large volumes of data and using `.value_counts()` and `groupby()` to explore distributions.
*   **Visualization (Matplotlib/Seaborn):** Creating histograms and log-log plots to identify non-normal distributions.
*   **Math/Stats Focus:**
    *   **Probability Distributions:** Recognizing that not all data is normally distributed. Introduction to skewed distributions like the Power Law / Pareto distribution.
    *   **Logarithmic Scales:** Understanding why log scales are essential for visualizing power law data.

#### **Key Tasks & Deliverables:**
1.  **Explore Engagement:** Write a query to get the number of `likes_given` for every user in the last 30 days.
2.  **Plot the Distribution:** In `Day_06_Challenge.ipynb`, create a histogram of this data. You'll notice it's highly skewed and unreadable.
3.  **Use a Log Scale:** Re-create the plot using a logarithmic scale on both the x and y axes. The data should now approximate a straight line, the classic signature of a power law.
4.  **Deliverable:** A completed notebook that includes the plots and a markdown cell explaining the Power Law concept and your hypothesis. **Example:** "Our user engagement follows a Power Law, where ~5% of users generate ~80% of all likes. My hypothesis is that our product's health is heavily reliant on this small group of 'power users,' and we should focus on retaining them."

### **# Day 07: The Pre-Mortem & Communicating Uncertainty**

#### **The PM's Briefing:**
"Final check before we lock in the launch plan. I want you to be a paranoid pessimist. What are the top 3 ways this launch could fail or, worse, hurt the business? I need you to identify these risks and, crucially, tell me how we'll measure them."

#### **Your Objective (As the Analyst):**
To identify business risks, connect them to specific guardrail metrics, and practice communicating risk and uncertainty to stakeholders.

#### **Technical Skill Focus:**
*   **Metric Design:** Thinking critically about what a metric truly represents and its potential failure modes.
*   **Clear Communication:** Translating complex analytical ideas (like cannibalization) into clear business risks.
*   **Math/Stats Focus:**
    *   **Confidence Intervals:** Re-introducing the concept of a confidence interval as a measure of uncertainty.
    *   **Risk Quantification:** Attaching a number to a risk (e.g., "There is a 40% user overlap between these two features, representing a risk of cannibalization.").

#### **Key Tasks & Deliverables:**
1.  **Draft the Memo:** In `reports/ab_test_analysis.md`, add a new "Risk Analysis (Pre-Mortem)" section.
2.  **Outline and Quantify Risks:** List your top 3 risks. For each, use data to quantify it.
    *   *Risk 1: Cannibalization.* "SQL analysis shows 40% of our power users' sessions include events from both the main feed and profile pages (where 'Journals' will live). We must monitor the `time_on_feed` guardrail metric closely."
    *   *Risk 2: Negative Social Impact.* "Power Creators (top 5%) produce 60% of public content. If even a fraction of them shift to private journaling, it could significantly harm network health."
3.  **Define Monitoring Plan:** For each risk, explicitly state the guardrail metric from your Day 3 plan that will be used to monitor it. For one of the metrics, state how you would use its confidence interval to make a decision. Example: "If the 95% CI for the change in `time_on_feed` includes a drop of more than 10 seconds, we will trigger an emergency review."
4.  **Deliverable:** The completed risk analysis section of the document.
