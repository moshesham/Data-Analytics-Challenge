# 30-Day Data Challenge

Welcome to the 30-Day Data Challenge! This repository is designed to help you build a strong daily habit of coding and problem-solving with data.

## How It Works

Each day, a new challenge will be presented in its own folder (e.g., `Day_01_...`). Your goal is to:
1.  Navigate to the day's folder.
2.  Read the challenge instructions in its `README.md`.
3.  Complete the tasks in the `challenge.ipynb` notebook.
4.  Once you've attempted the challenge, you can compare your work with the official solution in the `solutions` branch.

## Setup

You have two options to set up your environment. Docker is recommended for a hassle-free experience.

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)
1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
2. Run the command: `docker-compose up --build`
3. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided in your terminal (usually `http://127.0.0.1:8888`).

### Option 2: Conda
1. Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or Anaconda.
2. Create the environment from the file: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
3. Activate the environment: `conda activate 30day-challenge`
4. Start Jupyter Lab: `jupyter lab`
